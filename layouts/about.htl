I'm 19-year-old self-taught programmer who was interested in programming at a young age.
I like to build and try different things and am eager to learn more. I've now decided to study MIS at college, 
I also opened up a YouTube channel to share myself

    More of that, I'm building my website with using my own template engine which you can checkout on <a href="https://github.com/dogukan6durukan/template-engine">Github Link</a>.
    It's not perfect but I'm still at the edge of bootstrapping.
